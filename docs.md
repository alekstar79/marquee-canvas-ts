## Documentation and implementation features

### Architectural solutions:

1. **Single responsibility**:
  - `MarqueeController` - pure animation logic
  - `MarqueeCanvas` - integration with DOM as a custom element
  - `main.ts` - coordination and management of application status

2. **Typing**: Full TypeScript typing of all interfaces and functions

3. **Efficiency**:
  - Optimized rendering through the Canvas API
  - Debouncing resize handlers
  - Efficient animation control using requestAnimationFrame

4. **Availability**: Support for ARIA attributes and reduced-motion

5. **Responsiveness**: Automatic adaptation to changes in size and scale

### Main features:

- **Dual API**: Support for both custom elements and data attributes
- **Automatic container detection**: Smart search for the parent container to calculate the dimensions correctly
- **Caching resources**: Optimizing the loading of fonts and other resources
- **Error handling**: A comprehensive error handling system at all levels
- **Development and production**: Separate configurations for development and assembly

This project is a production-ready solution for creating high-performance live strings with full TypeScript support and a modern Vite-based toolchain.
